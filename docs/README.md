#  About this Tool

APIOps applies the concepts of DevOps to Azure API Management. This enables everyone involved in the lifecycle of API design, development, and deployment with self-service and automated tools to ensure the quality of the specifications and APIs that they're building. APIOps places the Azure API Management infrastructure under version control to achieve these goals. Rather than making changes directly in API Management portal, most operations happen through code changes that can be reviewed and audited. In this section, we include links to both a complementary Guide and Wiki to get you started with the tool.

Please bear in mind that APIOPS is designed to facilitate the promotion of changes across different Azure API Management (APIM) instances. While the animation below illustrates changes within the same instance, it's important to note that you can effortlessly apply your modifications across various Azure APIM instances using the supported configuration system. We advise taking some time to explore the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/apiops/wiki/Configuration) and [documentation](https://azure.github.io/apiops/apiops/5-publishApimArtifacts/apiops-azdo-4-1-pipeline.html) to grasp the functioning of configuration overrides when promoting changes across different environments.

## Complementary Guide

This guide is designed to bring a 400-level understanding of automating API deployments in Azure Api Management. This is meant to be a hands-on lab experience, all instructions are provided, but a basic level of understanding of apis, devops and gitops is expected.
This guide will guide you through the concept of APIOps. It applies the concepts of GitOps and DevOps to API deployment. By using practices from these two methodologies, APIOps can enable everyone involved in the lifecycle of API design, development, and deployment with self-service and automated tools to ensure the quality of the specifications and APIs that they're building.
[This Guide is delivered using Github Pages and Just-The-Docs theme](https://azure.github.io/apiops/).

## Wiki

The Wiki covers all of our supported resources. Think about it as being more resource-focused with deeper dives, as opposed to the aforementioned guide which is more scenario-based and holistic. So in essence you need to read both to have a successful adoption of the tool. [The wiki can be found on wiki tab within this repo or by following this link](https://github.com/Azure/apiops/wiki).
